      "Content": "Southgate deployed a 4-2-3-1 system on Sunday with Marc Guehi partnering John Stones at the back, Trent Alexander-Arnold starting alongside Declan Rice and Phil Foden starting down the left flank with freedom to roam.\r\n\r\nThe system and selections were justified during the opening half an hour as England dominated - but the Three Lions clung desperately to their one-goal advantage during the closing stages.\r\n\r\nDid Guehi and Stones do enough to keep their places in the side? Will Alexander-Arnold retain his starting berth in midfield? Should Foden drop to the bench after struggling to make an impact in Gelsenkirchen... or does he need to operate centrally?",
